# Python Fundamentals

This folder contains all the downloadable materials for my Udemy **Python Fundamentals** course, available here:

[]()

This folder is organized into the various chapters of the course, and those themselves are organized by lesson within each chapter.


Resources include:

- Fully annotated Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the coding lessons.
- Any files we used during the coding lessons.
- An extra section containing Exercises for each chapter containing two files:
	- A Jupyter notebook with the questions.
	- A second Jupyter notebook with a fully annotated solution (you may have a different way of solving the problem and that's absolutely fine, as long as your code works, and is clear and easy to read).


In the first chapter of this course I explain how to install and run Jupyter notebooks - please refer to that chapter if you need detailed instructions.
